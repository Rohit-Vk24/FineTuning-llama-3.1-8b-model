# Fine-tuning Meta's Llama 2 using Unsloth and Google Colab

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune Meta's Llama 2 large language model using the Unsloth library and Google Colab. It leverages the Alpaca dataset for fine-tuning and provides examples of text generation and model saving.

## Requirements

* **Google Colab environment:**  You'll need a Google Colab notebook to run this project.
* **Unsloth library:** Unsloth simplifies fine-tuning and inference with Llama 2 models. Install using `!pip install unsloth`.
* **Hugging Face Transformers library:** This provides essential tools for working with transformer models. Install using `!pip install transformers`.
* **Datasets library:** Used for loading and processing datasets, including Alpaca. Install using `!pip install datasets`.
* **TRL library:**  Provides functionalities for training with reinforcement learning. Install using `!pip install trl`.
* **Other dependencies:** Install additional requirements using:

## Installation

1. **Open a Google Colab Notebook:** Create a new notebook in your Google Colab environment.
2. **Install Libraries:** Copy and paste the following code into a code cell and execute it:

This will install all the necessary libraries for the project.

## Usage

1. **Load the Model and Tokenizer:**  Import the `FastLanguageModel` class from Unsloth and load the pre-trained Llama 2 model and tokenizer:
2. **Apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Use LoRA to fine-tune the model efficiently:
3.  **Prepare the Dataset:**  Load the Alpaca dataset and format it for fine-tuning:
4. **Fine-tune the Model:** Use the `SFTTrainer` from TRL to fine-tune the model:
5. **Generate Text:** After fine-tuning, use the model to generate text:
6. **Save the Model:**  Save the fine-tuned model locally or to the Hugging Face Hub:

## Advanced Options

* **Merging LoRA Weights:** You can merge the LoRA weights back into the base model for more efficient inference. Refer to the code comments for instructions.
* **Quantization:**  Further optimize the model size and inference speed using different quantization methods (GGUF format). Refer to the code comments for instructions.

## Notes

* This project uses a specific version of Llama 3.1 and the Alpaca dataset. You can adapt it to use other models and datasets.
* Experiment with hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and training steps to fine-tune for your specific use case.
* Consider using techniques like gradient accumulation to train with larger batch sizes if you have memory limitations.
* Refer to the Unsloth and Hugging Face documentation for more advanced options and configurations.
